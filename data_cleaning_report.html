Cleaning Report: Personalized Learning Dataset</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This report documents the data cleaning process applied to the
personalized learning dataset. The cleaning was performed using a
systematic approach to address various data quality issues and prepare
the dataset for further analysis.</p>
<h2 id="data-cleaning-process-summary">Data Cleaning Process
Summary</h2>
<p>The dataset was cleaned using a systematic approach that addresses
several common data quality issues:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Missing Values Handling</strong>: Missing values in
numerical columns were filled with median values, while categorical
columns used mode replacement.</li>
<li><strong>Standardization of Categorical Variables</strong>: Ensured
consistency in categorical values like Gender, Education_Level, and
Learning_Style.</li>
<li><strong>Outlier Detection and Handling</strong>: Used IQR
(Interquartile Range) method to identify and cap outliers in numerical
columns.</li>
<li><strong>Age-Education Discrepancies</strong>: Fixed inconsistencies
where age and education level didn’t align logically.</li>
<li><strong>Data Consistency Checks</strong>: Ensured logical
consistency across related fields and capped percentage values to be
within 0-100.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="specific-transformations-applied">Specific Transformations
Applied</h2>
<h3 id="missing-values-handling">1. Missing Values Handling</h3>
<ul>
<li>Numerical missing values (Age, Time_Spent_on_Videos, etc.) were
replaced with column medians</li>
<li>Categorical missing values were replaced with the most common value
(mode)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="categorical-standardization">2. Categorical Standardization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gender values were standardized to “Male”, “Female”, and
“Other”</li>
<li>Education_Level values were mapped to “High School”,
“Undergraduate”, or “Postgraduate”</li>
<li>Engagement_Level values were standardized to “Low”, “Medium”, or
“High”</li>
<li>Learning_Style values were standardized to “Visual”, “Auditory”,
“Reading/Writing”, or “Kinesthetic”</li>
<li>Dropout_Likelihood values were standardized to “Yes” or “No”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="outlier-handling">3. Outlier Handling</h3>
<ul>
<li>Outliers were detected using the IQR method (values outside 1.5 ×
IQR from Q1 and Q3)</li>
<li>Numerical outliers were capped (winsorized) at the lower and upper
bounds rather than removed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="age-education-discrepancies">4. Age-Education Discrepancies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed cases where students were too young for their listed education
level</li>
<li>Applied minimum age thresholds: High School (14), Undergraduate
(17), Postgraduate (20)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-consistency-checks">5. Data Consistency Checks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensured percentage columns (Quiz_Scores, Assignment_Completion_Rate,
Final_Exam_Score) were within 0-100</li>
<li>Fixed logical inconsistencies like positive Quiz_Scores with zero
Quiz_Attempts</li>
<li>Removed duplicate Student_ID entries if present</li>
</ul>
