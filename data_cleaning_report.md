# Data Cleaning Report: Personalized Learning Dataset

## Overview
This report documents the data cleaning process applied to the personalized learning dataset. The cleaning was performed using a systematic approach to address various data quality issues and prepare the dataset for further analysis.

## Data Cleaning Process Summary

The dataset was cleaned using a systematic approach that addresses several common data quality issues:

1. **Missing Values Handling**: Missing values in numerical columns were filled with median values, while categorical columns used mode replacement.
2. **Standardization of Categorical Variables**: Ensured consistency in categorical values like Gender, Education_Level, and Learning_Style.
3. **Outlier Detection and Handling**: Used IQR (Interquartile Range) method to identify and cap outliers in numerical columns.
4. **Age-Education Discrepancies**: Fixed inconsistencies where age and education level didn't align logically.
5. **Data Consistency Checks**: Ensured logical consistency across related fields and capped percentage values to be within 0-100.

## Specific Transformations Applied

### 1. Missing Values Handling
- Numerical missing values (Age, Time_Spent_on_Videos, etc.) were replaced with column medians
- Categorical missing values were replaced with the most common value (mode)

### 2. Categorical Standardization
- Gender values were standardized to "Male", "Female", and "Other"
- Education_Level values were mapped to "High School", "Undergraduate", or "Postgraduate"
- Engagement_Level values were standardized to "Low", "Medium", or "High"
- Learning_Style values were standardized to "Visual", "Auditory", "Reading/Writing", or "Kinesthetic"
- Dropout_Likelihood values were standardized to "Yes" or "No"

### 3. Outlier Handling
- Outliers were detected using the IQR method (values outside 1.5 Ã— IQR from Q1 and Q3)
- Numerical outliers were capped (winsorized) at the lower and upper bounds rather than removed

### 4. Age-Education Discrepancies
- Fixed cases where students were too young for their listed education level
- Applied minimum age thresholds: High School (14), Undergraduate (17), Postgraduate (20)

### 5. Data Consistency Checks
- Ensured percentage columns (Quiz_Scores, Assignment_Completion_Rate, Final_Exam_Score) were within 0-100
- Fixed logical inconsistencies like positive Quiz_Scores with zero Quiz_Attempts
- Removed duplicate Student_ID entries if present
